### Blog 9-21-2022
Today I cleaned up some code(which I will continue doing).
I also Added basic hashtags to the tweets to help with outreach.
Now I will work on a better cloud solution for hosting the bot before continuing improvements

### Blog 9-8-2022

WBB version 1.0 did what it set out to do, but there were 3 main issues:
1. few locations
2. low outreach
3. unreliable timing

I am currently working on a plan to fix these issues. My ideas so far are as follow:
- use CSV for locations for easy adding
- Add tailored hastags to the tweets for outreach
- Change deployment method (currently looking into a few other options with GC and AWS) 

### Version 1.0 : 5-19-2022

This is the initial live version of WBB on Twitter. The list of cities is currently small and mainly targetted towards West Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. The project is set to tweet updates every two hours
